/* Instruction on setting up 







*/


Build a community-based Twitter gateway, allowing groups of users to post to Twitter as a group.  
Individual users can submit updates, but they will not be posted to Twitter until other members of 
the group agree that they should be published.  Users can submit new updates, edit existing unpublished 
updates, or vote existing unpublished updates up or down.  When an update reaches a given number of votes,
it will be published.


Grading
Each of the following will be graded on a 2-point scale (0, 1, or 2 points):
Functionality - Does the application work as advertised?  Is it a reasonable approximation to the project description?
Error handling - Is there any attempt to handle, report, or recover from errors?  Is there any validation of input?
Documentation - Is there any?  Does it tell me how to get started? Is there any additional information that users will need?
Source code hygiene - Does JSHint pass?  Are lines indented appropriately?  Are there large chunks of unexplained commented-out code floating around?
Source code maintainability - Are there reasonable variable names? Are there modules?  If you needed to add some functionality or fix a bug, would it be easy to find the appropriate spot?
The following factors are each worth an additional point, up to a maximum of 10:
Aesthetics - Does it look nice?
Creativity - Does it do anything special?
